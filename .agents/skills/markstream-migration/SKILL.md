description: Audit and migrate existing Markdown rendering to Markstream. Use when Codex needs to replace another renderer, classify direct vs custom vs plugin-heavy usage, preserve behavior during adoption, migrate custom renderers into scoped Markstream overrides, or decide when `nodes` streaming is worth adopting.

# Markstream Migration

Use this skill when a repo already renders Markdown and the task is to adopt Markstream safely.

Read [references/adoption-checklist.md](references/adoption-checklist.md) before changing code.

## Workflow

1. Audit the repo's current renderer usage.
   - Search for markdown renderers, plugin chains, raw HTML handling, security props, and custom renderers.
   - List every call site that will be touched.
2. Classify the migration.
   - `direct`: simple string-in renderer swap.
   - `renderer-custom`: custom renderers but limited parser work.
   - `plugin-heavy`: remark, rehype, markdown-it, or other transform-heavy pipelines.
   - `security-heavy`: allow or deny lists, URL rewriting, sanitization, or raw HTML policies.
3. Swap the renderer first.
   - Introduce the correct Markstream package and CSS.
   - Import Markstream CSS through the package CSS subpath; do not rely on the renderer import to inject styles.
   - Preserve user-visible behavior before adding richer Markstream-only features.
   - Audit whether the old renderer allowed broad raw HTML or Mermaid loose-mode HTML labels before claiming parity.
4. Migrate custom renderers.
   - Convert tag-based renderers into node-type overrides with scoped `setCustomComponents`.
   - For trusted tag-like content, prefer `customHtmlTags`.
5. Review gaps honestly.
   - Do not claim 1:1 parity where none exists.
   - Call out parser, plugin, security, or HTML behavior that still needs manual review.
6. Consider renderer mode and smooth streaming before jumping to `nodes`.
   - For Vue 3, choose `mode="chat"` for AI/SSE output, `mode="docs"` for rich document surfaces, and `mode="minimal"` for lightweight non-chat surfaces.
   - If the app streams `content` and only needs pacing, `smooth-streaming="auto"` (the default) handles it without requiring `nodes`.
   - Move to `nodes` only when the app needs custom AST control, worker preparsing, or high-frequency structural updates.
   - When smooth streaming is on outside Vue 3 `mode="chat"` defaults, pair it with `:fade="false"`.
   - **Streaming vs recovering history**: when migrating a chat UI, keep `mode="chat"` on the same chat row and switch pacing/animation props instead. Vue 3 streaming: `mode="chat"`, `smooth-streaming="auto"`, `:fade="false"`. Vue 3 completed chat history: `mode="chat"`, `:smooth-streaming="false"`, optional `:fade="true"`. Use `mode="docs"` only for separate rich document surfaces.
7. Validate and summarize.
   - Run the smallest relevant tests or build.
   - Report direct mappings, TODOs, and remaining verification work.

## Default Decisions

- Renderer swap first, streaming optimization second.
- Smooth streaming is an intermediate option between "just content" and "full nodes migration": it paces visible output without requiring AST control.
- Preserve safety over feature parity when HTML or security rules are involved.
- Prefer explicit TODOs over vague claims.
- Recommend against migration when the current stack depends heavily on transforms that Markstream does not mirror directly.
- When preserving trusted legacy behavior is necessary, use scoped `htmlPolicy` / `html-policy="trusted"` and `mermaidProps.isStrict = false` instead of weakening defaults everywhere.
